<title>Gameplay - Loot</title>
<h1>What is loot?</h1>
<p>Loot is all the items that you can find inside of loot boxes. Loot boxes are small containers on the
    ground that contain different types of loot. <br><br>

    Looking for better loot? Look harder! Better loot is more difficult to obtain because
    the loot boxes are more difficult to find.<br>
</p>

<h1>How do I know if my loot is good?</h1>
<p>
    Each item that you obtain is part of a certain <b>tier of loot</b>. There are 5 tiers of loot, 
    as explained below. Some items are still good if they are lower tier, because they may have
    interesting uses.

<h1>Where do I find loot?</h1>
<p>
    Loot is found all over the place, but mostly in settlements, such as cities. It's hidden in corners, wedged in 
    objects, and concealed on tops of things.
    <br><br>
    Better loot is harder to find. You'll find all sorts of <b>Tier 1</b> loot on the ground in easy to spot places.
    <br><br>
    When a loot box is opened, it will respawn in a certain amount of time, usually between a half hour to a few hours. 
    Higher tiers of loot boxes take longer to respawn. 
</p>

<hr>

<h1>What kinds of loot boxes are there?</h1>
<p>
    There are three tiers of loot boxes: <b> Tier 1, Tier 2, </b>and <b>Tier 3</b>.
