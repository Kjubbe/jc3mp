<h1>What is Discord?</h1>
<p>
    Discord is a text and (optional) voice communication program, similar to Skype and Teamspeak. The Survival Island 
    team uses Discord very often to post updates, news, previews, and other related information, so it can 
    help you stay connected. You don't even need to download the program to use it! Just press F4, and it'll open
    up a window right here. (However, using the Discord client is highly recommended)
    <br><br>
    Discord is a great way to get in contact with us personally if you have comments, questions, or 
    concerns. Just @us and we'll do our best to help you out. It's also just a nice place to hang out with 
    others and discuss Survival Island.

<h1>Why join our Discord?</h1>
<p>
    Our Discord is a great way to communicate with us and tell us about what you think! We really do care about 
    how you feel about the server, so <i>please</i>, let us know! We can get back to you quickly and have 
    conversations about all the different aspects of the server. Even if we aren't online when you are, we will 
    still read your messages!
    <br><br>
    If you have bug reports, issues, comments, or just want to hang out, our Discord is the place! Fellow Survival Islanders 
    hang out here so you can chat with them and even arrange trades if you're looking for that one item.
    <br><br>
    Announcements are also posted to the Discord so that you can access the information right when it comes out!
