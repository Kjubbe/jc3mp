<h1>Why join our Steam Group?</h1>
<p>
    Our Steam Group is a great way for you to stay connected and up to date on all the latest happenings in 
    Survival Island. We'll post major announcements to the Steam Group when we release big updates, and you can 
    also give all the suggestions you want. We are listening! You can also chat with others about Survival Island.
    <br><br>
    The Steam Group is good for when you want your suggestions to stick on the page - 
    <a class='link' data-link="feedback/ourdiscord.html">Our Discord</a> is a better way to get quicker responses, since 
    it is built around chat rooms.
